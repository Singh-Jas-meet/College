# College
This repository contains the projects that I worked on as my classwork.
## Respository Structure
* Each unique project has it's own repository preceded by *-p-*, for example a project about a calculator would have all of it's files in the repository *_p_Calculator*.
* That will be stored in the main repository *College*.
>project directory structure: **College/-p-(project name)**, e.g.,  => **College/-p-Calculator**
