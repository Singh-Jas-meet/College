# College
This repository contains the projects that I worked on as my classwork.
## Respository Structure
Each project has it's own repository, for example a project about a calculator would have all of it's files in the repository **Calculator**.
Each project will be stored in a parent repository, basically with the name of the programming language it was created in, e.g., **Java**
This will be stored in the main repository **College**
> directory structure: **College/(language used)/(project name)**, e.g.,  => **College/Java/Calculator**
