# College
This repository contains the projects that I worked on as my classwork.
## Respository Structure
* Each project has it's own repository, for example a project about a calculator would have all of it's files in the repository *Calculator*.
* Each project will be stored in a parent repository, basically with the name of the programming language it was created in, e.g., *Java*
* This will be stored in the main repository *College*
>project directory structure: **College/(language used)/(project name)**, e.g.,  => **College/Java/Calculator**
